## Reflection

I created this as a side project to learn fullstack development. I aimed to build a website which would place the functionality of many sites I use into one domain.
This mainly being checking stats, checking upcoming tournaments, seeing the latest news and a place to discuss all things video-game related.

This project was quite challenging as I was essentially juggling learning React and Node all in the process of making this project.I struggled for a while to 
grasp the concept of React.js state and the idea of passing functions/state down components. This was significant learning curve.

I used React.js, Node.js and Express.js to create this project. I chose to use create-react-app, as it would save a lot of time with getting the project up and 
running. Better to get stuck in learning the new technology. However, in the future I plan to setup my own `webpack.config.js` file to better understand the build
process.
